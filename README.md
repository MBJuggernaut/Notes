## Notes
#A little application with options to write notes and remind about things you have to do. App uses API (openweather) and sql (works using databases). 

On the front page you can see a note screen -- that's where app name is from. There are also tabs for creating and observing tasks and for weather check. 

Tasks are sorted by dates. When creating new task, you can choose repeating and alarming options. There is only one tune available for now, more like a test option.
